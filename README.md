# SPARTA_GLOBAL_CALCULATOR

This is a calculator that consists of the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division functions as well as a couple of advanced options such as the square root and square function. This is my first project using JavaScript with HTML and CSS and it is linked through inline script tags in the head of the HTML page.

This calculator is a console based calculator where the answers to the calculations are displayed in the console of the web page. The console of the web page is accessed by right clicking and selecting the inspect button then the console tab of the panel or just by doing Ctrl+Shift+I.

The calculators have been split into two where the first option a user would get is the option to select on or the other. There is a regular option (+,-,/, *) and a advanced option (^,sqrt). The responses (calculations) of the user are inputted through JavaScript prompts that pop up and as mentioned above the answers are displayed through the console of the page.

This calculator uses JavaScript functions with variables and prompts as well as the parseInt function. This function parses a string and returns a integer hence how the calculator works through the use of prompts and the console. Math functions have also been included into the calculator. The math functions include Math.pow for the power of a number and Math.sqrt for the square root of a number which appear in the advanced calculator.
